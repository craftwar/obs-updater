I remove some plugins. You need more features, you need install them yourself or use official OBS Studio version instead.
It shares the same settings with official OBS, no extra setup is required.
**Don't install under system folder (ex: C:\Program Files (x86)\), updater can't write. Install in C:\craftwar_OBS or D:\craftwar_OBS ...etc
Don't delete downloaded .7z/zip files, it's used for update check. (delete it only when you encounter download problem)


Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 (x64 and x86) are required.
OBS may work abnormally under older Redistributable. Install 2019 please. (don't uninstall old Redistributable)

Installer is recommended	https://github.com/craftwar/obs-updater/releases/download/git/craftwar.OBS.installer.exe
It installs C++ Redistributable and create shortcut on desktop.
If you wana pin OBS to taskbar, pin desktop shortcut to taskbar or it won't run updater. (desktop shortcut can be deleted aftern pinned)


Updater updates craftwar's OBS studio only. (not including plugins you install)
Share updater only, not OBS you get from updating. (CPU specific version is slower in incorrect CPU)


Q:	How do I know I need update plugin?
A:	When OBS version is changed, you may need update it.
	Put newer plugin into OBS to overwrite it or download official OBS and overwite with my updater.
